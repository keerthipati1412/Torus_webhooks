**Print this page and check off items as you complete them**

---

## 📋 PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST (DO FIRST!)

- [ ] **Arduino IDE is CLOSED** ⚠️ Critical - it locks the COM port
- [ ] **Arduino connected** via USB to computer
- [ ] **Arduino connected to** COM6 (or note your COM port: _______)
- [ ] **Fingerprint sensor LED is ON** (green light visible)
- [ ] **Windows Device Manager** shows Arduino in Ports (COM & LPT)
- [ ] **Internet connection** available
- [ ] **Python 3.7+** installed (run: `python --version`)

✅ **All checked?** → Continue to Step 1

---

## 🚀 STEP 1: Install Python Packages

**Time: 2 minutes**

1. Open terminal/PowerShell
2. Navigate to project folder:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\manju\OneDrive\Desktop\Torus_implementation
   ```
3. Run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Wait for packages to install
5. See `Successfully installed`?
   - [ ] YES → Continue to Step 2
   - [ ] NO → Error message shows what failed, fix and retry

## 🔌 STEP 2: Start Flask Server

**Time: 1 minute**

### Option A: Run Script (Easiest)
1. Double-click: `START_BIOMETRIC_SERVER.bat`
2. Terminal opens and shows:
   ```
   ============================================================
   🔬 Biometric Fingerprint System - Arduino Integration
   ============================================================
   
   ✓ Serial connection established on COM6
   ✓ System initialized successfully
   
   🚀 Starting Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
3. If it shows errors:
   - [ ] "Serial port not connected" → Check COM port, Arduino not found
   - [ ] Other error → Check troubleshooting guide

### Option B: Run Manually
1. Open terminal
2. Go to project folder:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\manju\OneDrive\Desktop\Torus_implementation
   python biometric_server.py
   ```
3. Same output as above should appear

✅ **Server running?** → Continue to Step 3

---

## 🌐 STEP 3: Test Backend (Before Opening Website)

**Time: 2 minutes**

Open **second terminal** (leave Flask running in first)

### Test 1: Check Health
```powershell
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:5000/health" -Method Get
$response
```

Expected output:
```
status    : healthy
arduino   : connected
port      : COM6
baud      : 115200
```

- [ ] Healthy? → Continue
- [ ] Arduino disconnected? → Check COM port, Arduino connection

### Test 2: Test Arduino
```powershell
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:5000/test" -Method Get
$response
```

Expected output:
```
status  : success
message : Arduino connection successful
response: (some Arduino response)
```

- [ ] Success? → Continue
- [ ] Failed? → Arduino not responding, check troubleshooting

✅ **Both tests passed?** → Continue to Step 4

---

## 🔬 STEP 4: Test Arduino Directly (Optional but Recommended)

**Time: 2 minutes**

1. Close Flask server (press Ctrl+C)
2. Open Arduino IDE
3. Tools → Serial Monitor
4. Set baud rate to **115200** (dropdown on right)
5. Type in input box: `R1`
6. Press Send/Enter
7. Should see: `Saved` or `Error: ...`
   - [ ] YES → Sensor working ✓
   - [ ] NO → Sensor issue, see troubleshooting

8. Type: `F`
9. Should see: `Matched ID 1` or `Not matched`
   - [ ] YES → Working ✓
   - [ ] NO → Register fingerprint first with `R1`

10. Close Serial Monitor
11. Close Arduino IDE

✅ **Arduino working?** → Go to Step 5

---

## 🖥️ STEP 5: Start Flask Again

```bash
python biometric_server.py
```

Wait for server to start.

✅ **Server running?** → Continue to Step 6

---

## 📱 STEP 6: Test Registration Page

**Time: 2 minutes - The Main Test!**

1. Open browser (Chrome recommended)
2. Open file:
   ```
   file:///C:/Users/manju/OneDrive/Desktop/Torus_implementation/biometric-register.html
   ```
3. Should see:
   - Title: "Biometric Registration"
   - Fingerprint circle in center
   - Instructions: "Press and hold continuously"
   - Register & Finish button (grayed out)

4. **TEST: Press and hold the fingerprint circle**
   - Circle should glow (cyan color)
   - Progress ring should start filling
   - Scan line should move down
   - After 2 seconds: Check should turn green ✓
   - Button should enable
   - Status: "Fingerprint registered successfully"

- [ ] Everything worked? → Continue to Step 7
- [ ] Animation but no success? → Backend didn't respond, check Flask log
- [ ] Circle won't respond? → Browser issue, check console (F12)

---

## 🔐 STEP 7: Test Authentication Page

**Time: 2 minutes**

1. Open file:
   ```
   file:///C:/Users/manju/OneDrive/Desktop/Torus_implementation/biometric-auth.html
   ```

2. Should see:
   - Title: "Biometric Authentication"
   - Profile avatar with initials
   - Doctor name and email
   - Fingerprint circle
   - "Start Fingerprint Scan" button

3. **TEST: Click "Start Fingerprint Scan"**
   - Button should change to "Scanning..."
   - Circle should pulse (glow)
   - Place registered finger on sensor
   - Backend should send "F" command
   - Arduino should respond "Matched"
   - Circle should turn green ✓
   - Button should show "Verified"
   - Auto-redirect to dashboard

- [ ] Match successful? → Continue to Step 8
- [ ] Fingerprint not matched? → Register it first in Step 6
- [ ] Button doesn't respond? → Check browser console

## ⚙️ STEP 8: Test Admin Panel

**Time: 1 minute**

1. Open file:
   ```
   file:///C:/Users/manju/OneDrive/Desktop/Torus_implementation/biometric-admin.html
   ```

2. Should see:
   - System status cards (Backend, Arduino, COM6)
   - Register/Verify/Delete forms
   - Real-time operation log

3. **Status Cards:**
   - [ ] Backend: "Connected"
   - [ ] Arduino: "Connected"
   - [ ] COM Port: "COM6"

4. **Test Register:**
   - Enter ID: 2
   - Click "Register Fingerprint"
   - Log should show result

5. **Test Verify:**
   - Click "Start Verification"
   - Should show matched or not matched

6. **Test Delete:**
   - Enter ID: 2
   - Click "Delete Specific"
   - Confirm dialog
   - Should show deleted

- [ ] All operations logged? → You're done! 🎉

## 🆘 IF SOMETHING FAILS

**Don't panic!** This is normal. Follow this:

1. **Read the error message** carefully
2. **Check the terminal** where Flask is running
3. **Open browser console** (F12) and check for red errors
4. **Look up the error** in `BIOMETRIC-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
5. **Try the solution** listed
6. **Restart** (close Flask, close browser, start again)

### Most Common Issues:

❌ "Serial port not connected"
- Solution: Arduino IDE is running. CLOSE it.

❌ "Arduino test failed"
- Solution: Arduino not powered or sensor LED is off.

❌ "Fingerprint not matched"
- Solution: Register fingerprint first with R1.

❌ "Backend connection failed"
- Solution: Flask not running. Start Flask server.
